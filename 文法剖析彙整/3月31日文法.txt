As its tamari byproduct was so tasty, locals wanted a way to produce larger amounts of it.

They efficiently adapted the Kinzanji miso-making process to create soy sauce, a thinner, yet similar tasting, form of the tamari.

Established in 1841,/ Kadocho is one of the oldest of Yuasa's remaining soy sauce brewers;/ the soy sauce they produce is as close to the original type as you are likely to find anywhere in Japan.

2.the soy sauce they produce is as close to the original type/as you are likely to find anywhere in Japan.

它們製造的醬油接進原始的基底,你幾乎可以在日本任何地方找到.

As we descended from the loft, Kano walked me through the brewery and explained how the soy-sauce making process was adapted from that of Kinzanji miso.

Pointing out ancient wooden tools and iron equipment, he said that to make soy sauce, just two, rather than a variety, of grains, are used – steamed soybeans and toasted wheat – which are mashed rather than left whole (as is the case for Kinzanji miso) to better extract their flavour and umami.

這邊的- -插句,說明的是just two的穀物.

3.which are mashed rather than left whole (as is the case for Kinzanji miso) to better extract their flavour and umami.
